# GiardDesign - adRespect

This project was created during the recruitment process for adRespect agency.

## Below, I will list the most important aspects of the project.

- Created using the Bootstrap 5 library.
- The search bar is based on a Bootstrap 5 modal. I wrote my own script to show and hide this bar. It functions the same as tapping the magnifying glass and everywhere else.
- To create the slider in the header, I used the Swiper JS library.
- The photo gallery grid was created with the Masonry library. The popup gallery uses Bootstrap modal and Fancybox.
- The mobile burger menu from Bootstrap is enhanced with a script that allows it to be closed by tapping anywhere outside the menu. This feature is not included in the basic Bootstrap solution.
- In the footer, where the copyrights are located, I added a script that automatically updates the date.
- I added a cookies popup to the site. Currently, this website does not collect any data, but the feature is implemented in advance.
- Finally, the HTML was checked by the W3 validator, and the CSS and JS code were minified.

## The entire project is also available on the website:
